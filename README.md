## Description

This project was build to allow for users to quickly and effectively generate a logo. The main problem this application solves for a user is to bypass sorting through SVG documentation and having to manually input data, simply run the application in the CLI, answers a few prompts, and receive your custom logo. I learned how to use many new concepts including jest testing, class constructors, inheritance, and SVG. Using only Javascript, an application was able to be built from scratch without any sort of HTML or CSS.
